# In what way a pull request needs to be merged. This can be:
# * merge: creates a merge commit, combining the commits from the pull request on top of
#   the base of the pull request (default)
# * rebase: places the commits from the pull request individually on top of the base of the pull request
# * squash: combines all changes from the pull request into a single commit and places the commit on top
#   of the base of the pull request
# For more information see https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-request-merges/
mergeMethod: merge

# Optionally specify the merge commit message format. The following template
# tags are supported:
# * {title}: The pull request title at the moment it is merged
# * {body}: The pull request body at the moment it is merged
# * {number}: The pull request number
# * {branch}: The name of the source branch
# * {commits}: A list of merged commits
# When this option is not set, the merge commit message is controlled by
# GitHub and uses a combination of the title of the pull request when it was
# opened (note that later changes to the title are ignored) and a list of
# commits.
# This settings is ignored when `mergeMethod` is set to `rebase`.

# Blocking labels are the labels that can be attached to a pull request to make sure the pull request
# is not being automatically merged.
blockingLabels:
- blocked

# Whenever required labels are configured, pull requests will only be automatically merged whenever
# all of these labels are attached to a pull request.

# Automatic merges will be blocked if there is a match between the regular expression and title
